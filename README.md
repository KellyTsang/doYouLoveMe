Welcome to the ultimate game of cat and mouse in the realm of romance!

Do You Love Me? 💖
Picture this: You land on a webpage with an adorably coy title asking, "Do you love me?" As you stare at the screen, a playful red button boldly says "No," daring you to click it. Ah, but here's the twist: the button doesn't want to make it easy for you! 🏃‍♂️💨

The Great Button Chase
Hover Magic: The moment you move your cursor toward that cheeky "No" button, it zips away to a new spot on your screen. You thought love was tricky? Try catching this button! 😂

Button's Final Surrender: When you finally manage to click it (after some good laughs and probably a few frustrated sighs), the button goes all soft and admits, "Yes ❤️." Talk about a twist!

Love in the Air
Heart Explosion: Now, as if your persistence wasn't enough, the website showers you with floating hearts. These charming little hearts rise and fade, creating a whimsical, love-filled ambiance. 💕✨

This website isn't just asking a question—it's giving you a mini romantic adventure, testing your love and patience in the most delightful way! Ready to chase some love?
